                                <h2>What is a Ductless Mini-Split System?</h2>
                                <p>A ductless mini-split system is a type of heating and cooling system that does not
                                    require the use of ducts. It uses
                                    a heat pump to efficiently deliver warm or cool air directly into various rooms in a
                                    home or building. Also known
                                    as mini-split or multi-split heat pumps or ductless mini-split air conditioning
                                    systems.</p>
                                <br>

                                <img src="<?php echo $base_url; ?>/img/lennox-mini-split-tc1.jpg" alt="water heater"
                                    style="width:70%" ;="">
                                <br>
                                <p>Ductless mini-split heating and cooling units use small heating and cooling air
                                    handlers for every individual
                                    room, so installing a ductless mini-split system makes it easy to set up heating and
                                    cooling zones in your home.
                                    This means each room in your home can be at a different temperature and comfort
                                    level.</p>

                                <p>Some of our mini-split ductless systems can accommodate up to four indoor units that
                                    can provide heating or cooling,
                                    and each of these air handlers can be controlled individually via its own wireless
                                    thermostat.</p>

                                <p>Since mini splits have no need for ducts, they avoid the energy losses associated
                                    with the ductwork of central air
                                    systems. Heated or cooled air lost through leaky or uninsulated ducts in your home
                                    can account for more than 30%
                                    of energy consumption for space conditioning, especially if the ducts are in an
                                    unconditioned space such as an
                                    attic. So this makes a ductless mini-split highly energy efficient.</p>

                                <p>Popular uses of ductless mini-split systems include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Older Homes </strong>– Great heating and cooling solution for older

                                        system in place. For example, an older home with a boiler-style heating system
                                        has no ducting.</li>
