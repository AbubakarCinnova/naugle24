                                <h2>The Importance of Professional Air Duct Cleaning</h2>

                                <p>The air ducts in homes should be professionally cleaned as needed to ensure optimal
                                    indoor air quality. While furnace filters on most modern central air systems capture
                                    a good percentage of particulates, they are primarily designed to protect the
                                    central air system rather than solely for air purification. Without an add-on air
                                    purification system such as the Lennox PureS, particulates can accumulate in your
                                    air ducts over time. This build-up of dust, pollen, and dander can circulate
                                    throughout your home every time your AC or furnace runs, creating an environment
                                    troublesome for allergies and asthma sufferers.</p>

                                <h2>How to Know if Your Ducts are Dirty:</h2>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>You find yourself cleaning your air vents more than once per month.</li>
                                    <li>You're experiencing an increase in allergy symptoms.</li>
                                    <li>You notice more dust accumulation on furniture near air vents.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>If you observe any of these signs, it's advisable to contact Naugle Heating and
                                    Cooling for professional evaluation and consider scheduling an air duct cleaning to
                                    ensure optimal indoor air quality.</p>
