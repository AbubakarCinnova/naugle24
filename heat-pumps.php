                                <p><strong>Naugle Heating and Cooling: Professionally Installed High-Efficiency
                                        Dual-Fuel Heat
                                        Pumps for Year-Round Comfort in Michigan Homes</strong></p>



                                <p>Heat pumps are gaining popularity among Michigan homeowners for their
                                    dual-functionality
                                    as heating and cooling systems. When paired with an energy-efficient furnace, they
                                    create a versatile dual-fuel system, providing comfort year-round. In warmer months,
                                    the
                                    heat pump acts as an efficient air conditioner, while in colder months, it extracts
                                    heat
                                    from the outdoor air to keep homes warm.</p>



                                <p>For optimal performance, the heat pump works best above 35 degrees Fahrenheit, with
                                    the
                                    furnace taking over as the primary heating source as temperatures drop further.
                                    Combining a Lennox or Carrier heat pump with a high-efficiency furnace creates an
                                    energy-saving dual-fuel system, reducing reliance on a single energy source and
                                    ensuring
                                    comfort even on the coldest days.</p>
