                                <h2>What are VOCs?</h2>

                                <p>Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) are gases emitted from indoor sources like building
                                    materials and cleaning products, posing health risks such as eye irritation and
                                    respiratory issues. Long-term exposure can even increase cancer risk. To reduce
                                    exposure, opt for low-VOC products, improve ventilation, and use air purifiers with
                                    activated carbon filters and UV-C light technology, such as the Healthy Climate®
                                    In-Duct Air Purifier.</p>

                                <h2>Understanding Formaldehyde</h2>

                                <p>Formaldehyde is a colorless, strong-smelling gas commonly found indoors. Exposure can
                                    lead to respiratory irritation, allergic reactions, and long-term health risks,
                                    including cancer. The Healthy Climate® In-Duct Air Purifier effectively removes
                                    formaldehyde and other indoor air pollutants, ensuring a healthier indoor
                                    environment for you and your family.</p>
